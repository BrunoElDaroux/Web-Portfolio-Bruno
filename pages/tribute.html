        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Steve Jobs's life:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1955</strong> - Born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco,
            California.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1968</strong> - In the early part of 1970, Jobs’ meets the
            future Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, through a mutual friend and
            the two get along quite well despite their four-year age difference.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1972</strong> - Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland,
            Oregon. However, he dropped out after one semester as he felt that
            he was not getting anything out of it. Although, Steve Jobs did
            continue auditing calligraphy classes at Reed College which kept him
            interested.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1976</strong> - Wozniak had designed and built his own
            computer-cum-logic board which he called the Apple I. With Jobs’
            help, they founded Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) in 1976 and
            released their first product, the Apple I, later that year.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1980</strong> - On December 12, 1980, Apple went public and
            in just its initial public stock offering, managed to raise $110
            million, more capital than any IPO since Ford in 1956! They made
            history that day, creating more millionaires than any other public
            offering had ever created before.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1985</strong> - The conception of the Macintosh made Jobs’
            uncompromising nature quite evident, from the design creation to its
            eventual launch. The resulting disagreements kept festering within
            the company and concerned Apple employees finally resulting in an
            open power struggle between Steve Jobs and Apple CEO John Sculley.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1996</strong> - The administration of Apple changes hands
            again, from Michael Spindler to Gil Amelio on February 2, 1996.
            After a thorough briefing on the admin management, Amelio learned
            that even prolonged efforts could not develop or produce an
            alternate for the aging Macintosh OS. Instead, he chose to purchase
            NeXT for $430 Million for the NeXTstep OS that Job's and his team
            had developed.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>2003</strong> - Steve Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic
            cancer in mid-2003 but put off surgery while seeking alternative
            medical approaches. In 2004, he underwent the Whipple surgery that
            seemed to have removed the tumor successfully. In Jobs absence,
            Apple was run by Timothy D. Cook, the head of worldwide sales and
            operations.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>2007</strong> - Steve Jobs introduces Apple’s first iPhone
            to the world at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007 with its
            official release scheduled on June 29, 2007.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>2008</strong> - Steve Jobs was always secretive about his
            health concerns and never voiced them out loud. His drastic weight
            loss started raising public concerns which amounted to a simple
            common bug and hormonal imbalance issues. A few days after Steve
            Jobs declared he was fit to continue working, he took a few days off
            for a medical leave. It was later learned that Steve Jobs had
            undergone a liver transplant at the Methodist University Hospital in
            Memphis, Tennessee.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>2011</strong> - In January of 2011, Steve Jobs took a second
            medical leave of absence with no particular duration raising more
            speculations about his failing health. While he was still involved
            in major decision-making processes, Tim Cook was given the heads up
            to run day-to-day operations.
            <br />
            In August of 2011 Jobs finally resigns from his position as CEO of
            Apple, naturally replaced by COO Tim Cook. On October 5, 2011, Apple
            co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs passed away at the age of 56
            after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. His death was widely
            mourned with many tributes pouring in from around the world.
